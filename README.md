### This project implements a seat booking system that allows users to manage seat bookings for an event or transportation. The system allows for the following actions:

### 1.Add a new booking
### 2.Cancel an existing booking
### 3.Update a seat booking with a new seat number
### 4.Display all current bookings
### The system manages bookings using a list of seats, each of which can be booked, canceled, or updated.
